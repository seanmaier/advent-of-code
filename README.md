# Advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2024! ðŸŽ„âœ¨ This project contains solutions to the daily programming puzzles, implemented in C#.

Each day's solution is organized into its own project directory, providing a clean structure for managing and running individual solutions.

# Repository Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day-1.proj/   # Solution for Day 1
â”œâ”€â”€ day-2.proj/   # Solution for Day 2
â”œâ”€â”€ day-3.proj/   # Solution for Day 3
...
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md     # You're here!
```

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
.NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine to build and run the projects.

## Running a Solution
Navigate to the desired project directory:

```
cd day-1.proj
```

Add a ``input.txt`` to the directory
Otherwise you will get an error, for missing a ``.txt`` file

Build and run the project:

```
dotnet run
```
